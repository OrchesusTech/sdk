## Overview

**ORCHESUS** is an AI-powered engineering system that generates production-ready pull requests — not drafts, not playground experiments.

It understands your codebase, follows your architecture, respects your lint rules, and submits clean, review-friendly PRs that integrate seamlessly into your workflow.

No scaffolding.
No half-baked snippets.
Just shippable code.

## Why ORCHESUS?

Traditional AI coding tools generate fragments.

ORCHESUS generates:

- ✅ Fully structured Pull Requests  
- ✅ Clean commits with logical separation  
- ✅ Tests included  
- ✅ Lint-passing code  
- ✅ CI-compatible changes  
- ✅ Documentation updates  
- ✅ Migration scripts (when needed)

It writes code that *folds up in review*.
